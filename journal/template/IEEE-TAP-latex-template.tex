\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} file is intended to serve as a ``sample article file''
for IEEE journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b and later. The most common elements are covered in the simplified and updated instructions in ``IEEEtran\_how-to.pdf.''  It is assumed that the reader has a basic working knowledge of \LaTeX. Those who are new to \LaTeX \ are encouraged to read Tobias Oetiker's ``The Not So Short Introduction to \LaTeX ,'' available at: \url{http://tug.ctan.org/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf} which provides an overview of working with \LaTeX.

\section{The Design, Intent, and \\ Limitations of the Templates}
The templates are intended to {\bf{approximate the final look and page length of the articles/papers}}. {\bf{They are NOT intended to be the final produced work that is displayed in print or on IEEEXplore\textsuperscript{\textregistered}}}. They will help to give the authors an approximation of the number of pages that will be in the final version. The structure of the \LaTeX\ files, as designed, enable easy conversion to XML for the composition systems used by the IEEE. The XML files are used to produce the final print/IEEEXplore pdf and then converted to HTML for IEEEXplore.

\section{Where to Get \LaTeX \ Help --- User Groups}
The following online groups are helpful to beginning and experienced \LaTeX\ users. A search through their archives can provide many answers to common questions.
\begin{list}{}{}
\item{\url{http://www.latex-community.org/}} 
\item{\url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/} }
\end{list}

\section{Other Resources}
See \cite{ref1},\cite{ref2},\cite{ref3},\cite{ref4},\cite{ref5} for resources on formatting math into text and additional help in working with \LaTeX .

\section{Text}
For some of the remainer of this sample we will use dummy text to fill out paragraphs rather than use live text that may violate a copyright.

Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are strongly
encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses).
This applies to papers in data storage. For example, write ``15
Gb/cm$^{2}$ (100 Gb/in$^{2})$.'' An exception is when
English units are used as identifiers in trade, such as ``3\textonehalf-in
disk drive.'' Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes
and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because
equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly
state the units for each quantity in an equation.

The SI unit for magnetic field strength $H$ is A/m. However, if you wish to use
units of T, either refer to magnetic flux density $B$ or magnetic field
strength symbolized as $\mu _{0}H$. Use the center dot to separate
compound units, e.g., ``A$\cdot $m$^{2}$.''  The surface electromyography(sEMG) is among the most direct bio-potential signals representing muscle movement information. sEMG is used to evaluate motor conditions in medical and research fields, and it is currently expanding into more general fields, such as health monitoring, prosthesis and orthosis control, and human-machine interfaces. Accordingly, there is an increasing demand for an overall sensor system capable of long-term stable signal recording, and including an intention decoding algorithm.

Recently, textile-based sEMG sensor have been getting attention for long-term wearable sensor system. Textiles ensure comfort to the wearer by modifying their shape to fit the body curvature.

\IEEEpubidadjcol

Therefore, in this research, we propose an sEMG sensor system from the fast and precise customizable fabrication method of the fabrics sEMG sensor to motion intention algorithm. We introduce a 2.5D laser-cutting-based fabrication method on the densely weaved conductive fabric. Because the entire manufacturing process can be automated without human intervention, as shown in \eqref{deqn1} mint aut quat eos explis ad quodi debis deliqui aspel earcius.

\begin{equation}
\label{deqn1}
x = \sum_{i=0}^{n} 2{i} Q.
\end{equation}

Mass production is also possible and sensors of various sizes and shapes necessary for the different human body parts can be exactly manufactured as designed. In addition, within the range where laser cutting is possible, various attempts in previous studies on electrodes can be employed. In this study, we integrated foams with robust performance for EEG and ECG with a focus on long-term use. While previous studies have shown the feasibility of foam electrodes, this study shows how electrodes containing foamed electrodes can be grafted into the proposed fabrication method and their performance for use as small-sized sEMG sensor electrodes. Our proposed sEMG system integrates a motion intention algorithm to form a complete and intelligent muscle interface from fabrication to application. Among many sEMG-based intention recognition applications, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our sEMG system by gesture recognition, as hand gestures are among the most intuitive methods for human communication and human-machine interaction.


\section{Some Common Elements}
\subsection{Sections and Subsections}
Enumeration of section headings is desirable, but not required. When numbered, please be consistent throughout the article, that is, all headings and all levels of section headings in the article should be enumerated. Primary headings are designated with Roman numerals, secondary with capital letters, tertiary with Arabic numbers; and quaternary with lowercase letters. Reference and Acknowledgment headings are unlike all other section headings in text. They are never enumerated. They are simply primary headings without labels, regardless of whether the other headings in the article are enumerated. 

\subsection{Citations to the Bibliography}
The coding for the citations is made with the \LaTeX\ $\backslash${\tt{cite}} command. 
This will display as: see \cite{ref1}.

For multiple citations code them separately with comas as follows: {\tt{$\backslash$cite\{ref1\}, $\backslash$cite\{ref2\}, $\backslash$cite\{ref3\}}}
 which will produce \cite{ref1}, \cite{ref2}, \cite{ref3}.

\subsection{Lists}
In this section, we will consider three types of lists: simple unnumbered, numbered, and bulleted. There have been many options added to IEEEtran to enhance the creation of lists.\\

\subsubsection*{\bf A plain  unnumbered list}
\begin{list}{}{}
\item{bare\_jrnl.tex}
\item{bare\_conf.tex}
\item{bare\_jrnl\_compsoc.tex}
\item{bare\_conf\_compsoc.tex}
\item{bare\_jrnl\_comsoc.tex}
\end{list}

\subsubsection*{\bf A simple numbered list}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{bare\_jrnl.tex}
\item{bare\_conf.tex}
\item{bare\_jrnl\_compsoc.tex}
\item{bare\_conf\_compsoc.tex}
\item{bare\_jrnl\_comsoc.tex}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{\bf A simple bulleted list}
\begin{itemize}
\item{bare\_jrnl.tex}
\item{bare\_conf.tex}
\item{bare\_jrnl\_compsoc.tex}
\item{bare\_conf\_compsoc.tex}
\item{bare\_jrnl\_comsoc.tex}
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Figures}
\hyperref[fig1]{Fig. 1} is an example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
 Note that $\backslash${\tt{label}} must occur AFTER (or within) $\backslash${\tt{caption}}.
 For figures, $\backslash${\tt{caption}} should occur after the $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}}.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{fig1}
\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

\hyperref[fig2ab]{Fig. 2(a) and 2(b)} is an example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
 (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
 The subfigure $\backslash${\tt{label}} commands are set within each subfloat command,
 and the $\backslash${\tt{label}} for the overall figure must come after $\backslash${\tt{caption}}.
 $\backslash${\tt{hfil}} is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
 The combined width of all the parts of the figure should do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%
\begin{figure*}[!t]
\centering
\subfloat[]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{fig1}%
\label{fig2a}}
\hfil
\subfloat[]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{fig1}%
\label{fig2b}}
\caption{An example of a double-column wide (or page wide) floating figure using two subfigures.}
\end{figure*}

Note that often IEEE papers with multi-part figures do not place the labels within the image itself (using the optional argument to $\backslash${\tt{subfloat}}[]), but instead will
 reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
 Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
 labels, the optional argument to $\backslash${\tt{subfloat}} must be present. If a
 subcaption is not desired, leave its contents blank,
 e.g.,$\backslash${\tt{subfloat}}[].


 

\section{Tables}
Note that, for IEEE-style tables, the
 $\backslash${\tt{caption}} command should come BEFORE the table. Table captions use title case. Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions (and, but, for, or, nor), and most short prepositions are lowercase unless they are the first or last word. Table text will default to $\backslash${\tt{footnotesize}} as
 the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
 The $\backslash${\tt{label}} must come after $\backslash${\tt{caption}} as always.
 
\begin{table}[!t]
\caption{An Example of a Table\label{tab:table1}}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
One & Two\\
\hline
Three & Four\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Algorithms}
Algorithms should be numbered and include a short title. They are set off from the text with rules above and below the title and after the last line. Algorithm titles should be in title case, followed by ending punctuation.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Weighted Tanimoto ELM.}\label{alg:alg1}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE 
\STATE {\textsc{TRAIN}}$(\mathbf{X} \mathbf{T})$
\STATE \hspace{0.5cm}$ \textbf{select randomly } W \subset \mathbf{X}  $
\STATE \hspace{0.5cm}$ N_\mathbf{t} \gets | \{ i : \mathbf{t}_i = \mathbf{t} \} | $ \textbf{ for } $ \mathbf{t}= -1,+1 $
\STATE \hspace{0.5cm}$ B_i \gets \sqrt{ \textsc{max}(N_{-1},N_{+1}) / N_{\mathbf{t}_i} } $ \textbf{ for } $ i = 1,...,N $
\STATE \hspace{0.5cm}$ \hat{\mathbf{H}} \gets  B \cdot (\mathbf{X}^T\textbf{W})/( \mathbb{1}\mathbf{X} + \mathbb{1}\textbf{W} - \mathbf{X}^T\textbf{W} ) $
\STATE \hspace{0.5cm}$ \beta \gets \left ( I/C + \hat{\mathbf{H}}^T\hat{\mathbf{H}} \right )^{-1}(\hat{\mathbf{H}}^T B\cdot \mathbf{T})  $
\STATE \hspace{0.5cm}\textbf{return}  $\textbf{W},  \beta $
\STATE 
\STATE {\textsc{PREDICT}}$(\mathbf{X} )$
\STATE \hspace{0.5cm}$ \mathbf{H} \gets  (\mathbf{X}^T\textbf{W} )/( \mathbb{1}\mathbf{X}  + \mathbb{1}\textbf{W}- \mathbf{X}^T\textbf{W}  ) $
\STATE \hspace{0.5cm}\textbf{return}  $\textsc{sign}( \mathbf{H} \beta )$
\end{algorithmic}
\label{alg1}
\end{algorithm}


\section{Mathematical Typography \\ and Why It Matters}

Typographical conventions for mathematical formulas have been developed to {\bf provide uniformity and clarity of presentation across mathematical texts}. This enables the readers of those texts to both understand the author's ideas and to grasp new concepts quickly. While software such as \LaTeX \ and MathType\textsuperscript{\textregistered} can produce aesthetically pleasing math when used properly, it is also very easy to misuse the software, potentially resulting in incorrect math display.

IEEE aims to provide authors with the proper guidance on mathematical typesetting style and assist them in writing the best possible article. As such, IEEE has assembled a set of examples of good and bad mathematical typesetting \cite{ref1}, \cite{ref2}, \cite{ref3}, \cite{ref4}, \cite{ref5}. 

Further examples can be found at \url{http://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/IEEE-Math-Typesetting-Guide-for-LaTeX-Users.pdf}

Please use standard LaTeX codes for symbols when possible. Avoid using personal customized macros or definitions as they may not be supported at IEEE.

\subsection{Display Equations}
The simple display equation example shown below uses the ``equation'' environment. To number the equations, use the $\backslash${\tt{label}} macro to create an identifier for the equation. LaTeX will automatically number the equation for you.
\begin{equation}
\label{deqn_ex1}
x = \sum_{i=0}^{n} 2{i} Q.
\end{equation}

\noindent is coded as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
\label{deqn_ex1}
x = \sum_{i=0}^{n} 2{i} Q.
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}

To reference this equation in the text use the $\backslash${\tt{ref}} macro. 
Please see (\ref{deqn_ex1})\\
\noindent is coded as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
Please see (\ref{deqn_ex1})\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Equation Numbering}
{\bf{Consecutive Numbering:}} Equations within an article are numbered consecutively from the beginning of the
article to the end, i.e., (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), etc. Do not use roman numerals or section numbers for equation numbering.

\noindent {\bf{Appendix Equations:}} The continuation of consecutively numbered equations is best in the Appendix, but numbering
 as (A1), (A2), etc., is permissible.\\

\noindent {\bf{Hyphens and Periods}}: Hyphens and periods should not be used in equation numbers, i.e., use (1a) rather than
(1-a) and (2a) rather than (2.a) for subequations. This should be consistent throughout the article.

\subsection{Multi-Line Equations and Alignment}
Here we show several examples of multi-line equations and proper alignments.

\noindent {\bf{A single equation that must break over multiple lines due to length with no specific alignment.}}
\begin{multline}
\text{The first line of this example}\\
\text{The second line of this example}\\
\text{The third line of this example}
\end{multline}

\noindent is coded as:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{multline}
\text{The first line of this example}\\
\text{The second line of this example}\\
\text{The third line of this example}
\end{multline}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent {\bf{A single equation with multiple lines aligned at the = signs}}
\begin{align}
a &= c+d \\
b &= e+f
\end{align}
\noindent is coded as:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{align}
a &= c+d \\
b &= e+f
\end{align}
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt{align}} environment can align on multiple  points as shown in the following example:
\begin{align}
x &= y & X & =Y & a &=bc\\
x' &= y' & X' &=Y' &a' &=bz
\end{align}
\noindent is coded as:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{align}
x &= y & X & =Y & a &=bc\\
x' &= y' & X' &=Y' &a' &=bz
\end{align}
\end{verbatim}





\subsection{Subnumbering}
The amsmath package provides a {\tt{subequations}} environment to facilitate subnumbering. An example:

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:2}
\begin{align}
f&=g \label{eq:2A}\\
f' &=g' \label{eq:2B}\\
\mathcal{L}f &= \mathcal{L}g \label{eq:2c}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\noindent is coded as:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:2}
\begin{align}
f&=g \label{eq:2A}\\
f' &=g' \label{eq:2B}\\
\mathcal{L}f &= \mathcal{L}g \label{eq:2c}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Matrices}
There are several useful matrix environments that can save you some keystrokes. See the example coding below and the output.

\noindent {\bf{A simple matrix:}}
\begin{equation}
\begin{matrix}  0 &  1 \\ 
1 &  0 \end{matrix}
\end{equation}
is coded as:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
\begin{matrix}  0 &  1 \\ 
1 &  0 \end{matrix}
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent {\bf{A matrix with parenthesis}}
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\
 i &  0 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
is coded as:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\
 i &  0 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent {\bf{A matrix with square brackets}}
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 
1 &  0 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
is coded as:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 
1 &  0 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent {\bf{A matrix with curly braces}}
\begin{equation}
\begin{Bmatrix} 1 &  0 \\ 
0 & -1 \end{Bmatrix}
\end{equation}
is coded as:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
\begin{Bmatrix} 1 &  0 \\ 
0 & -1 \end{Bmatrix}
\end{equation}\end{verbatim}

\noindent {\bf{A matrix with single verticals}}
\begin{equation}
\begin{vmatrix} a &  b \\ 
c &  d \end{vmatrix}
\end{equation}
is coded as:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
\begin{vmatrix} a &  b \\ 
c &  d \end{vmatrix}
\end{equation}\end{verbatim}

\noindent {\bf{A matrix with double verticals}}
\begin{equation}
\begin{Vmatrix} i &  0 \\ 
0 & -i \end{Vmatrix}
\end{equation}
is coded as:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
\begin{Vmatrix} i &  0 \\ 
0 & -i \end{Vmatrix}
\end{equation}\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Arrays}
The {\tt{array}} environment allows you some options for matrix-like equations. You will have to manually key the fences, but there are other options for alignment of the columns and for setting horizontal and vertical rules. The argument to {\tt{array}} controls alignment and placement of vertical rules.

A simple array
\begin{equation}
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
a+b+c & uv & x-y & 27\\
a+b & u+v & z & 134
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
is coded as:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
a+b+c & uv & x-y & 27\\
a+b & u+v & z & 134
\end{array} \right)
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}

A slight variation on this to better align the numbers in the last column
\begin{equation}
\left(
\begin{array}{cccr}
a+b+c & uv & x-y & 27\\
a+b & u+v & z & 134
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
is coded as:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
\left(
\begin{array}{cccr}
a+b+c & uv & x-y & 27\\
a+b & u+v & z & 134
\end{array} \right)
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}

An array with vertical and horizontal rules
\begin{equation}
\left( \begin{array}{c|c|c|r}
a+b+c & uv & x-y & 27\\ \hline
a+b & u+v & z & 134
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
is coded as:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
\left(
\begin{array}{c|c|c|r}
a+b+c & uv & x-y & 27\\
a+b & u+v & z & 134
\end{array} \right)
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}
Note the argument now has the pipe "$\vert$" included to indicate the placement of the vertical rules.


\subsection{Cases Structures}
Many times cases can be miscoded using the wrong environment, i.e., {\tt{array}}. Using the {\tt{cases}} environment will save keystrokes (from not having to type the $\backslash${\tt{left}}$\backslash${\tt{lbrace}}) and automatically provide the correct column alignment.
\begin{equation*}
{z_m(t)} = \begin{cases}
1,&{\text{if}}\ {\beta }_m(t) \\ 
{0,}&{\text{otherwise.}} 
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
\noindent is coded as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation*}
{z_m(t)} = 
\begin{cases}
1,&{\text{if}}\ {\beta }_m(t),\\ 
{0,}&{\text{otherwise.}} 
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
\end{verbatim}
\noindent Note that the ``\&'' is used to mark the tabular alignment. This is important to get  proper column alignment. Do not use $\backslash${\tt{quad}} or other fixed spaces to try and align the columns. Also, note the use of the $\backslash${\tt{text}} macro for text elements such as ``if'' and ``otherwise.''

\subsection{Function Formatting in Equations}
Often, there is an easy way to properly format most common functions. Use of the $\backslash$ in front of the function name will in most cases, provide the correct formatting. When this does not work, the following example provides a solution using the $\backslash${\tt{text}} macro:

\begin{equation*} 
  d_{R}^{KM} = \underset {d_{l}^{KM}} {\text{arg min}} \{ d_{1}^{KM},\ldots,d_{6}^{KM}\}.
\end{equation*}

\noindent is coded as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation*} 
 d_{R}^{KM} = \underset {d_{l}^{KM}} 
 {\text{arg min}} \{ d_{1}^{KM},
 \ldots,d_{6}^{KM}\}.
\end{equation*}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{ Text Acronyms Inside Equations}
This example shows where the acronym ``MSE" is coded using $\backslash${\tt{text\{\}}} to match how it appears in the text.

\begin{equation*}
 \text{MSE} = \frac {1}{n}\sum _{i=1}^{n}(Y_{i} - \hat {Y_{i}})^{2}
\end{equation*}

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation*}
 \text{MSE} = \frac {1}{n}\sum _{i=1}^{n}
(Y_{i} - \hat {Y_{i}})^{2}
\end{equation*}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.


{\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
Use $\backslash${\tt{appendix}} if you have a single appendix:
Do not use $\backslash${\tt{section}} anymore after $\backslash${\tt{appendix}}, only $\backslash${\tt{section*}}.
If you have multiple appendixes use $\backslash${\tt{appendices}} then use $\backslash${\tt{section}} to start each appendix.
You must declare a $\backslash${\tt{section}} before using any $\backslash${\tt{subsection}} or using $\backslash${\tt{label}} ($\backslash${\tt{appendices}} by itself
 starts a section numbered zero.)}
