\noindent\textbf{Acknowledgements}\\[0.25cm]
First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Ding-Bing Lin, my supervisor at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, for his initiative and valuable assistance, especially in the design production. I would also like to thank my Czech supervisor, \foreignlanguage{czech}{Pavel Hazdra}, for his professional help, willingness, and reliable correspondence throughout our collaboration, which was conducted remotely during my double degree program in Taiwan. Furthermore, I express my utmost gratitude to Universal Microwave Technology, Inc., for promptly and precisely fabricating the prototype. Namely, I would like to mention the principal engineer Jethro Wang who helped with finalizing the design for manufacturability and obtaining raw measurement data taken from the production site.

Last but not least, I would like to thank all my loved ones who supported me from afar throughout my studies, especially my family and friends. Special thanks go to \foreignlanguage{czech}{Ester Jančaříková} for standing by me and helping me through difficult times.
