\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis details the design, simulation, fabrication, and measurement of a novel dual circularly polarized antenna operating in the operating band from $\frequencyrange$. The system comprises a square waveguide polarizer with chamfered corners, a dual-coaxial feed, and a conical horn antenna. The polarizer generates right-hand and left-hand circular polarization by selectively exciting one of the two fundamental modes of the square waveguide. The dual coaxial feed provides the necessary excitation. The conical horn, designed using Antenna Magus and adapted to the polarizer, achieves target gain. CST Studio Suite was used for electromagnetic simulations, while Python with SciPy enabled dynamic optimization for enforcing geometric constraints. The fabricated antenna's measured performance closely aligns with simulations, demonstrating an axial ratio below $\qty{4}{dB}$ and a gain of approximately $\qtyrange{12}{15}{dBi}$ across the band. This work contributes to a compact, manufacturable, dual circularly polarized antenna design with potential applications in satellite communications, radar, and other wireless systems.\\[0.25cm]
